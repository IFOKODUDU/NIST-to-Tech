# NIST-to-Tech

An open-source listing of cybersecurity technologies and vendor tools mapped to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Recognizing the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable function of critical infrastructure, an [Executive Order in 2013](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity) instructed the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) published a [cybersecurity framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework) for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

The framework focuses on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organizationâ€™s risk management processes.

## The Technology

What's not included in the framework, however (and rightfully so), is a guide on how to leverage the many various cybersecurity technologies and open-source tools available today to achieve the goals of the framework.

Organizations are all complex in different ways. Technology and it's implementation is nuanced and results can often vary. There is no one-size-fits-all or truisms when it comes to technology, other than the fact that every organization needs technology and needs ways to secure their business.

This project is meant to be a guide and a starting point to help the community in making cybersecurity technology decisions that map to the NIST CSF. This will give you a framework to see how your current tools measure up and see what you may be missing and need to consider.
